# Arduino-Measuring-Distance
Ultrasonic transducers (ultrasonic sensors) are used in systems which evaluate targets by interpreting the reflected signals (similar to radar and sonar). For example, by measuring the time between sending a signal and receiving an echo the distance of an object can be calculated. Passive ultrasonic sensors are microphones that detect ultrasonic noise that is present under certain conditions.
Ultrasonic distance sensor provides precise, non-contact distance measurements from about 2 cm to 400 cm.
This project aims to use Arduino to
Measure the distance from an object using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic                                                                   sensor.
